This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

-   Create a file `.env.local`
-   Add `THE_ONE_AUTH_KEY` with your auth key from [https://the-one-api.dev/sign-up](https://the-one-api.dev/sign-up)

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/api/movies](http://localhost:3000/api/movies) with your browser to see the results of fetching from the `/movies` endpoint.

Open [http://localhost:3000/api/quotes](http://localhost:3000/api/quotes) with your browser to see the `/quotes` result from a random Lord of the Rings movie.
